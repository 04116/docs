Installing .NET Desktop Framework
=================================
.. note::
    The .NET Desktop Framework is supported only on Windows.

Installing the .NET Desktop Framework is very easy, and it might not even be required! If you have Windows installed, you more than likely already have the runtime installed with it. This will allow you to run programs written to run on .NET Framework, but it will not be enough for you to develop programs on your own. For this, you will need to install some SDKs and tools.

If you happen to not have the Framework already installed, there are two main ways to get it:

* Via a dedicated installer
* Via Windows Update

Getting the installer
---------------------
You can get the links to installers for various .NET versions on `MSDN <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5a4x27ek(v=vs.110).aspx>`_. Simply pick the version you are interested in, click the link and follow the instructions.

Getting the framework via Windows Update
----------------------------------------
There is nothing special to do here, except run Windows update and view optional updates, selecting and letting WU do its work.

Getting the SDKs
----------------
When you've installed the actual Framework, you can check out `Visual Studio <https://www.visualstudio.com/>`_ to enable you to get started building .NET applications.
