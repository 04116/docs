# What is Windows Presentation Foundation

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for .NET Core is a UI framework that creates desktop client applications. The WPF development platform supports a broad set of application development features, including an application model, resources, controls, graphics, layout, data binding, documents, and security. WPF uses the Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to provide a declarative model for application programming.

## XAML

XAML is a declarative XML-based language used to define visual aspects of WPF, such as windows, controls, and visual styles. XAML is the primary way the visual element to a component is designed, separating the UI from the logic of the application.
