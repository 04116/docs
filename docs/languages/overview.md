# ðŸ”§ .NET Platform & programming languages

As a developer, you can choose any programming language that supports the .NET Framework to create your application. Because the .NET Framework provides language independence and interoperability, you can interact with other .NET Framework applications and components regardless of the language with which they were developed.
Languages that allow you to develop applications for the .NET Framework adhere to the [Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification]()https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/mt639507.
