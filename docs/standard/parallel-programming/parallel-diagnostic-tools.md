# Parallel Diagnostic Tools
[!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_ext](../../../includes/vs-dev10-ext-md.md)] provides extensive support for debugging and profiling multi-threaded applications.  
  
## Debugging  
 The Visual Studio debugger adds new windows for debugging parallel applications. For more information, see the following topics:  
  
-   [Using the Parallel Stacks Window](../Topic/Using%20the%20Parallel%20Stacks%20Window.md)  
  
-   [Using the Tasks Window](../Topic/Using%20the%20Tasks%20Window.md)  
  
-   [Walkthrough: Debugging a Parallel Application](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Debugging%20a%20Parallel%20Application.md).  
  
## Profiling  
 The Concurrency Visualizer report views enable you to visualize how the threads in a parallel program interact with each other and with threads from other processes on the system. For more information, see [Concurrency Visualizer](../Topic/Concurrency%20Visualizer.md).
