# Getting started with C# #

This section provides short, simple tutorials that let you quickly build an application using C# and .NET Core. There are getting started topics for Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017 RC, and Visual Studio Code. You can build either a simple Hello World application or, if you have Visual Studio 2017, a simple class library that can be used by other applications. 

The following topics are available: 

- [Building a C# Hello World application with .NET Core in Visual Studio 2017 RC](with-visual-studio-2017.md)

   Visual Studio 2017 RC,  the latest release of Visual Studio, lets you code, compile, run, debug, profile, and publish your applications from a integrated development environment for Windows.

   The topic lets you create and run a simple Hello World application and then modify it to run a slightly more interactive Hello World application. Once you've finished building and running your application, you can also learn how to [debug it](.\debugging-with-visual-studio-2017.md) and how to [publish it](.\publishing-with-visual-studio-2017.md) so that it can be run on any platform supported by .NET Core.

- [Getting started with Visual Studio Code](with-visual-studio-code.md)

   Visual Studio code is a programming editor for Windows, Linux, and macOS that supports IntelliSense (code completion) and debugging.

   This topic shows you how to create and run a simple Hello World application with Visual Studio code and .NET Core.

- [Building a C# Hello World application with .NET Core in Visual Studio 2017 RC](with-visual-studio-2017.md)

   Visual Studio 2015, like the later Visual Studio 2017 RC,  lets you code, compile, run, debug, profile, and publish your applications from a integrated development environment for Windows.

   The topic lets you create and run an interactive Hello World application. Once you've finished building and running your application, you can also learn how to [debug it](.\debugging-with-visual-studio.md) and how to [publish it](.\publishing-with-visual-studio.md) so that it can be run on any platform supported by .NET Core.
